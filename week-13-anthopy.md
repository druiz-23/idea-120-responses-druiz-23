After the reading this week, one question did come to mind. What do video games have that traditional games don’t have? The author does a great job at explaining the differences within the formats they exist in.  Videogames have the advantage of being more immersive. In addition, they have a chance to explore different scenarios or explorations than traditional games. 
Aside from diverse scenarios in videogames there is ample opportunities for creators to create complex stories from videogames. Traditional games are mostly team based or player-based games. However, video games are based on putting a player in scenarios and or put them in the shoes of the character. This is true when it comes to the videogame mentioned in the reading, Gangrape, it puts the player in the scenario of a gangrape situation. The creator’s intention was to create something where the player can be put in that situation and make decisions based on that scenario. Moreover, this game would have never been made if it was up to mainstream corporations. Luckily due to small video game creators, we can explore these stories and expand our minds to distinctive situations. 
Although I’ve never been much of a gamer but through this class, I’ve realized how video games are stories, where you ultimately become the author of its chapters. Your decisions dictate the flow, levels achieved, anticipation, wins & losses of the game. Whereas traditional games use more strategic thinking and keeping score by players as part of the mechanics of a traditional game. Ultimately, video games create more spaces to explore several adventures within the same game while traditional gaming only gives you one outcome.
