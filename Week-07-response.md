  In the reading Birdle points out on the algorithm and the system put in place to popularize content created specifically for children. 
He mentioned how these word salads are constantly used to promote and target auidences. Futhermore, the use of these word salads seem to not have much correlation with certain content but it used just to as a technique to target younger audiences.
  Birdle shows examples of this content which I agree uses these terms to attract auidences which may not be inapproriate for them. Word salad masks the content that is created within these videos. Almost like fake advertisements that are presented online. They are promoted as kid friendly content but have a darker side to them. They use cartoons and children characters in the video to attract young audiences but the content contains violent or graphic scenerios in the video. 
 As Birdle mentions, it results in children becoming traumatized and effected from watching these videos. And has been linked to psychological effects due to the distrubing images being presented at such a young age. Unfortunately, it all comes back to revenue and how much income can be made through these overly graphic saturation of children's videos. 
 The content made through this is not based on creating content for children but rather the mass amount of views or searches created through bots to create income.
