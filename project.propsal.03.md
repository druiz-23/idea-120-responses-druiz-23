I plan to make a twine game that revolves around the emotions or thoughts around getting a new puppy. It will lead the user through different scenarios and paths depending on your choices to train or not train your puppy. 
It will also show the different emotions you can feel when having a new puppy to take care of e.g. (happiness, frustration, and inadequacy). I would like to add graphics or photos of puppies or activities that center around puppies. 
The ending to the game may differ depending on how much attention and training are given to the puppy. I hope this will help users get in the mindset of being an owner/parent of a new puppy and the steps that need to be taken.
