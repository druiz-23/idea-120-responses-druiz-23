'game' creation tools
 	Allowing for a larger accessibility to gaming could lead to exploring much more ground in terms of artistic design and subject matter that is not readily seen in the mainstream. If they were public produced games that could be relatable to minorities or underrepresented communities. It would set a more diverse and artistic realm in gaming. 					If they were larger number of diverse creators that oversaw the creation of games, it would gain different perspectives. The gaming industry is usually controlled by white cis men that only support one view that doesnâ€™t lend to other perspectives. If the gaming industry could benefit from other diverse creators that could include a more cultural & specific niches that the mainstream does not publicize. It would offer marginalized communities an entity to relate to and give them a space to explore and navigate through new scenarios. 
With having distinct creators in the gaming industry, it would propel fans and audiences to see themselves in another life and affect them with their vision for the future. New games can give audiences the positive outlook for underrepresented communities that is rarely seen in mainstream media.
