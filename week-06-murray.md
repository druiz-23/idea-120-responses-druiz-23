I believe that most of Murray's predictions in the reading were correct.
Murray mentioned that the digital format would be a space for artists, human connection and broadcasting live events as a new format for entertainment and connecting with others. 
She predicted how the television, phone and computer would eventually become one. This would be be vital for entertainment and navagation purposes. 
Murray was spot on in their predictions when it came to interactive and fantasy space. The Maladarian is a testement of how the digital space is spliling into the production of television. 
It is advancing the visuals to become more interactive and customizable to the production process. And gives the auidence a more realistic view of the environment that is being portrayed in the film due to virtual sets.
