Throughout O’Neil’s chapter and Chalabi’s video they outline the media tools used such as ads, surveys, campaigns that are paraded in front of the user who is being targeted. Most of it stems from google searches that are made online. Once a user googles a term or an item, the data from this search is instantly used to created targeted ads or campaigns that correlate with the term or item. 

I think the internet would be more useful and egalitarian without the methods we are subjected to online. We would be exposed less to content that is targeted at us that harm and or give us false information. It would give us all an opportunity to have the same information and create our own unbiased opinions through egalitarian media. Although we would have millions of media content to sift through, we would have an open source of content that could give us all the information without it being distorted or create funds for WMD’s.
