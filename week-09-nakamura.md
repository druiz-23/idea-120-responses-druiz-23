From the reading, I took away how new media designers are closely correlated to being directors of films. Their vision is what us the viewers get to see on the screen. They get to orchestrate how the digital landscape is designed. Similarly, we are asked to follow along with a design of the interactive media created by these designers.
One aspect or tool that I believe is used now that can reflect the mental structure and identity are the use of Avatars through Snapchat. The creation and activity of creating an avatar can stem directly from the designer’s mental structure. They decide how all the avatar’s facial animations, expressions, racial identity, and composition overall. These can also be used as signal to other on their emotional state.  It is a portal through which they generate ideologies of gender, race, and aesthetics.
