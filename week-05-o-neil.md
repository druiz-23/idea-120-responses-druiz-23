  I found the reading of the "Weapons of Math Destruction" by Cathy O'Neil to be an eye-opening read. I never would have thought how many mathematical models are created to make decisions in our society. 
An example that I can think of is how banks tend to use this sort of model to see who qualifies for loans for a home or for a car. 
As Cathy mentioned, there are many reasons as to why people have a struggling financial history.
Unfortunately, these models do not create space for these variables and keep their formula rigid regardless of the individual.  
These models are made to be cookie cutter and straight forward system while not putting into account people's lives and circumstances that can create shift in their finances.
	Moreover, the use of a “WMD” that is used on the incarcerated people seems to be one of the worst examples. The use of this probability model can change a person’s entire life and trajectory. 
Many of the questions asked to inmates are geared to give those who have a checkered past an unfavorable outcome with their future. 
And is a game of probability of their likelihood of them returning to prison without giving them a chance. 
  No matter what type of “WMD” is used it is not a fool proof system and comes with risks. These models are more closely related to a result of probability.  
I am shocked that these models have not become adjusted with time and or created to adhere to multiple situations. 
The creators of “WMD” are not concerned about those they affect with their probability model and rather care about the money they will gain from it.
